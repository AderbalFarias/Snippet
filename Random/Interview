- At the end of an interview, ask the interviewer questions similar to these:
How will you know you've made the right choice on hiring me or someone else?
What are some things a new employee could do that would make him a successful new hire? 

(These type of questions would make the interviewer see you as eager to become sucessfull as a new hire.)
